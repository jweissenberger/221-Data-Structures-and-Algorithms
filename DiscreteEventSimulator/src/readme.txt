Jack Weissenberger Project 3
Eltopic Simulation

This program is a discrete event simulator that simulates and estimates the amount of time
students will have to wait for food at Eltopic. It uses linked lists and queues to store the
information regarding their arrival, departure and student information. It takes in a text file
that contains the seed number, number of grad and undergrad students, arrival rates of both, 
and the service rate of both.

It then out puts the Queue delay average, minimum, and maximum and the System delay, which is
the queue plus the service, average, minimum, and maximum.
