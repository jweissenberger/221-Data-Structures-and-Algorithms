# 221 Data Structures and Algorithms

Analysis, implementation, and application of abstract data structures such as lists, stacks, queues, trees, hash tables, heaps, and graphs. Complexity analysis of algorithms that operate upon these structures

DLinkedList: simple implementation of a doubly linked list

DiscreteEventSimulator: uses doubly linked lists and queues to simulate the amount of time someone might spend waiting at a resturant.

Hashtable: a spellchecker that stores correctly spelled words in a hash table that handels collisions with an AVL tree

Lab1: a spellchecker that stores correct words in a doubly linked list

Spellchecker: duplicate of Lab1

Spellchecker2.0: This is a spellchecker that uses 3 different kinds of self updating lists to sort the most important words to the top of the list

Trees: use binary search trees and AVL trees to store and search inventory data
