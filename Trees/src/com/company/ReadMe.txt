Jack Weissenberger Project 4
Inventory Database

In this project I use a binary search tree and an AVL tree to store inventory data. The inventory
data is read in from a text file from a command line argument. Inventory.java contains the main
and reads in the text file. Binary treeNode.java is an interface for the nodes of the trees. 
LinkedBinaryTreeNode.java contains the class for the linked tree nodes. BinarySearchTree.java is
a class that defines the BST. AVLTree.java is a class that extens BST with self updating 
functions.
